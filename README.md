# Citadel Summer Invitational Datathon

## Team 11

### Datathon Description
Highly selective datathon hosted by Citadel, Citadel Securities and Correlation-One for students passionate about data science from top universities around the world. A total of 80 competitors were selected out of a couple thousand applicants.

### Problem Description
Today, the US airline industry is one of the most critical engines of our economy. Although its
constituents have had its ups and downs, from reasonable profitability to bankruptcy and bailout
in the 2000s, it has survived and remained a mainstay. Additionally, as a key barometer of US
commercial travel, it can often serve as a leading indicator of consumer discretionary spending
and leisure activity. As the world becomes more interconnected, and we find better and more
exciting ways to visualize and explore these connections, the airline industry will continue to be a hotspot of activity and interest.
### Research Questions

We decided to go in-depth about the following topics:

01 How does the severity and seasonality of weather conditions correlate with the magnitude of flight delays? 

02 Is there a specific weather severity threshold or a particular season during which flights are disproportionately impacted by delays?
